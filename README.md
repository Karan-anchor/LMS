This project implements a Library Management System (LMS) using static arrays and structures in C++. It focuses on performing essential data operations on an array of book records, such as adding, updating, searching, displaying, and deleting books. This project serves as an introductory application of data structures in a real-world context, demonstrating how structured data and simple algorithms can be used to simulate a management system.
